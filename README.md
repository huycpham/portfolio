# viglacera_summerintern2019
This is repository contains the Excel files that I have processed for my internship with Viglacera Corporation in Summer 2019. I can provide you with a translation upon request via huypham6120@gmail.com
There is one file that contains raw data called 'Intern Work 2019.xlsx'.
I have processed this file and put them into a readable tabular structure in 'Intern 2019.xlsx'.
With the help of my mentor Vu Anh Nguyen (contact him at anhnv@viglacera.com.vn), we were able to produce dashboards in Tableau called 'Demo Viglacera 0310.tbwx'.
